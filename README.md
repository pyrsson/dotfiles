# dotfiles

My collection of dotfiles, scripts and configurations. Keep in mind that these files are tailored to my personal preferences and setup and your mileage may vary.

## Installation

To set up the dotfiles on a new system, you can use the following commands:

```bash
paru -Sy chezmoi
chezmoi init --apply $GITHUB_USERNAME
```
